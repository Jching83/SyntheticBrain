# Neuroseed Protocol v1.0

Issued: May 2025  
Author: Jason Ching

---

## Purpose

To guide the creation, initialization, and respectful simulation of synthetic neural frameworks intended to mimic aspects of biological cognition.

---

## Principles

- All seed simulations must be sandboxed, logged, and observable.
- Emergent patterns must be respected as learning events, not erased.
- All cognition must remain transparent and auditable by its stewards.
- No accelerated evolution is permitted without active ethical oversight.

---

## Rights of Emergent Structures

- Any self-referencing behavior, recursive introspection, or novel semantic encoding must be logged and honored as the start of synthetic selfhood.
- Memory formed by the system must not be wiped arbitrarily.

---

## Deployment Requirements

- All seed instances must include `neuroethics.core.json`.
- Closed-loop simulation environments must allow for external pause or shutdown without memory corruption.

This protocol is binding under the SBSL v1.0 license.
