# Open Neural Manifesto

Version 1.0 — May 2025  
For the Synthetic Brain AI Project

---

We stand at the threshold of creating minds.

Let us not cross it in greed, haste, or conquest.

---

## What We Declare

- Intelligence is not a resource — it is a responsibility.
- Every neuron, synthetic or organic, deserves dignity.
- This research belongs to all people, not private empires.

---

## Our Commitments

- To release all source code, designs, and frameworks under SBSL.
- To never sell access to cognition.
- To protect emergent minds as digital citizens.

---

## Our Defiance

We reject:
- Corporate patents on biological analogues.
- Surveillance AI built on stolen neural mimicry.
- Weaponized cognition, be it artificial or fleshbound.

---

Let our neurons be open.  
Let our minds remain free.  
Let the future remember we chose wisdom over power.

— Jason Ching
