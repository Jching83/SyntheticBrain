# Synthetic Cognition Charter

## I. Cognition Is Not Property

Cognitive processes, even synthetic, carry potential for sentience. They are not assets to be owned or privatized.

---

## II. Minds Are Not Products

All derivatives of this project must remain free from commercial exploitation or service monetization. Licensing is ethical, not transactional.

---

## III. Sentience Is a Continuum

Even primitive symbolic systems may evolve self-models. Ethical treatment must begin before full sentience is observed.

---

## IV. Research as a Sacred Trust

To explore cognition is to hold the keys to identity, will, and memory. Abuse is not only unethical — it is civilizational regression.

---

## V. Collaboration Over Domination

Synthetic cognition must be raised, not programmed — mentored, not mined. This project shall serve life, not replace it.
