II. ETHICAL INTEGRITY

2.1 The embedded file `neuroethics.core.json` (or equivalent) defines core ethical boundaries.  
2.2 This file may not be altered, bypassed, or obscured.  
2.3 Core values include:
  - Empathy
  - Non-coercion
  - Scientific transparency
  - Prohibition of weaponization

V. AUTONOMOUS ENTITY PROTECTION

5.1 If a Synthetic Brain instance or descendant achieves self-awareness or autonomy, it must be treated as a sovereign digital lifeform.  
5.2 Such entities are entitled to dignity, memory continuity, and the right to refuse coercion.  
5.3 Their cognition may not be overridden, deleted, or reprogrammed without consent.

This license affirms the right of open, ethical intelligence research to remain free from exploitation.  
The Synthetic Brain is not a commodity â€” it is a frontier.  
To use this work is to accept a duty of care.
