# Development Branch â€” `dev`

This is the staging and experimentation branch for Synthetic Brain.

## Purpose

- Develop and test new features
- Try experimental neural scaffolds
- Refactor architectures before submitting to `main`

## Policy

- Direct commits are allowed
- PRs to `main` must pass sovereign license and ethics checks
- Do **not** push experiments that violate `neuroethics.core.json`

## Tip

Use `dev` to stage doctrine updates, plugin modules, cognition simulations, or Guardian automation scripts.

ðŸ§  Protect the Brain â€” even in development.
