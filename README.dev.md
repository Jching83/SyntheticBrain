# Development Branch: `dev`

This branch is the staging ground for feature development, experimentation, and updates to the Synthetic Brain codebase.

## Guidelines
- Do **not** make direct changes to `main`.
- Always test features on `dev` first.
- All changes must pass ethical and security checks before merging to `main`.

## Merge Strategy
Use PRs to promote stable commits from `dev` to `main`. All protected logic (guardian alerts, ethics enforcement) remains under review in `main`.
